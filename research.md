## Research themes

My research activities rely on the development of **semi-Lagrangian Vortex methods** to simulate incompressible flows.
These works are applied for instance to the following problems :

### Flow past bluff bodies

_Flow past a sphere at Re=300_

### Passive flow control using porous media
![PassiveControl](/assets/images/passive_control_HS.jpg)
_Influence of a porous layer on the flow dynamics around a hemisphere (simplified model of a side view mirror) at Re=1000_

### Subgrid scale model for Vortex methods to perform _bi-level_ simulations

_Taylor Green vortex at Re=1600. Comparison between DNS results obtained
with a 256^(3) resolution and results obtained with an anisotropic subgrid scale model and a 256^(3)(vorticity)-64^(3)(velocity) resolution_
