My research activities rely on the development of **semi-Lagrangian Vortex methods** to simulate incompressible flows.
These works are applied for instance to the following problems :

### Flow past bluff bodies

_Flow past a sphere at Re=300_

### Passive flow control using porous media

_Influence of a porous layer on the flow dynamics around a hemisphere (simplified model of a side view mirror) at Re=1000_

### Subgrid scale model for Vortex methods to perform _bi-level_ simulations
