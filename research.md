## Research themes

My research activities rely on the development of **semi-Lagrangian Vortex methods** to simulate incompressible flows.
These works are applied for instance to the following problems :

### Flow past bluff bodies

_Flow past a sphere at_ $Re=300$

$ax+b =toto$

### Passive flow control using porous media
![PassiveControl](/assets/images/passive_control_Re1000.png)  

_Influence of a porous layer on the flow dynamics around a hemisphere (simplified model of a side view mirror) at_ $Re=1000$

### Subgrid scale model for Vortex methods to perform _bi-level_ simulations

_Taylor Green vortex at Re=1600. Comparison between DNS results obtained
with a 256<sup> 3 </sup> resolution (left pictures) and results obtained with an anisotropic subgrid scale model and a 256<sup> 3 </sup> (vorticity)-64<sup> 3 </sup> (velocity) resolution (right pictures)_
