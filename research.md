## Research gallery

My research activities rely on the development of numerical methods (in particular **semi-Lagrangian Vortex methods**) to simulate incompressible flows.
These works are applied for instance to the following problems :

### Flow past bluff bodies

_Flow past a sphere at Re=300_

### Passive flow control using porous media

_Influence of a porous layer on the flow dynamics around a hemisphere (simplified model of a side view mirror) at Re=1000_

→ more results and details [here](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01483400/document)

**Stability analysis for passive flow control with porous media**

Is a porous layer able to delay the transition to a more turbulent flow regime ? Is this delay monotonously related to the permeability of the added porous layer ?
The stability analysis is an efficient tool to answer these questions:
